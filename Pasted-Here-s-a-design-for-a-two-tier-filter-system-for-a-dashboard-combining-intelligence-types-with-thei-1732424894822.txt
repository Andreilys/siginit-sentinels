Here’s a design for a two-tier filter system for a dashboard, combining intelligence types with their corresponding sub-types, and integrating a filter dropdown based on the Admiralty/NATO System for intelligence evaluation.

Two-Tier Filter System Design
Tier 1: Primary Filter
The first dropdown menu filters by the broad intelligence types:

IMINT (Imagery Intelligence)
SIGINT (Signals Intelligence)
HUMINT (Human Intelligence)
OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)
CYBERINT (Cyber Intelligence)
Tier 2: Sub-Type Filter
Each intelligence type has corresponding sub-categories:

IMINT (Imagery Intelligence)

Satellite imagery
Drone surveillance
Aerial photography
Ground-based photography
SIGINT (Signals Intelligence)

Radio intercepts
Communications monitoring (e.g., phone tapping)
Electronic signals (e.g., radar detection)
Encryption analysis
HUMINT (Human Intelligence)

Spies and covert operatives
Informants
Diplomatic sources
Prisoner interrogations
OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)

Social media monitoring
News media and publications
Academic research
Public forums and websites
CYBERINT (Cyber Intelligence)

Malware analysis
Dark web monitoring
Network traffic analysis
Threat intelligence feeds
Admiralty/NATO System Filter Design
The Admiralty System evaluates intelligence based on reliability of the source and credibility of the information. You can use a dropdown with the following options for additional filtering:

Source Reliability (Rating A–F):
A: Completely reliable
B: Usually reliable
C: Fairly reliable
D: Not usually reliable
E: Unreliable
F: Reliability cannot be judged
Information Credibility (Rating 1–6):
1: Confirmed by other sources
2: Probably true
3: Possibly true
4: Doubtful
5: Improbable
6: Truth cannot be judged
Dashboard Filtering Example
Primary Filter: Select OSINT
Sub-Type Filter: Select Social Media
Admiralty System Filter:
Source Reliability: B (Usually reliable)
Information Credibility: 2 (Probably true)
Interface Layout
First Dropdown (Tier 1): Type of Intelligence
Second Dropdown (Tier 2): Sub-Type
Admiralty Filter Dropdowns:
Source Reliability: A–F
Information Credibility: 1–6
